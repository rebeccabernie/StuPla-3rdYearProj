# StuPla User Guide

StuPla was created with the intent of being an app that is super simple to use, without any prior knowledge of the app. If I can't figure out how to use an app within a few seconds of opening it then it's highly unlikely I'll open it again, and I kept this in mind when designing the app. The simple user interface means all functionality is relatively straightforward, but I included a user guide page in the app just in case. Here's a copy of the guide:

## Add A New Assignment
Tap "Add New Assignment" bar at the bottom of the screen. Enter your assignment title, due date and worth.  
Click the "Save" button.

## Delete An Existing Assignment

Tap on the assignment you want to delete and select "Delete Assignment" on the prompt.

## Edit An Assignment

Tap on the assignment you want to edit and select "Edit Assignment" from the prompt.  
Enter the updated information into the fields and click the save button.  
If you change your mind before saving simply tap the back button in the top left corner.  
*Be careful when editing - once you save the changes, old information can't be retrieved!*
