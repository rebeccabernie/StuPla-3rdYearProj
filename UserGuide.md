# StuPla User Guide

StuPla was created with the intent of being an app that is super simple to use, without any prior knowledge of the app. If I can't figure out how to use an app within a few seconds of opening it then it's highly unlikely I'll open it again, and I kept this in mind when designing the app. 

### Create an Account

Tap "Create Account" on the log in screen. Enter your details - make sure your email is valid! Click the "Create Account" button.  
The screen should show a prompt to let you know that you've successfully created an account.

### Log In

Make sure you have an account set up with StuPla.  
Enter your email and password and click the "Login" button.

### Reset a Password

Don't worry if you forget your password, simply click on the "Forgot Password?" link towards the bottom of the log in page.  
You'll be presented with an input box - enter your email here and click "Send".  
Check your emails - you should have an email from StuPla, containing a reset link. Click the link, enter your new password in the box and click save.

## App Features

The simple user interface means all functionality is relatively straightforward, but I included a basic user guide page in the app just in case. Here's a copy of the guide:

### Add A New Assignment
Tap "Add New Assignment" bar at the bottom of the screen. Enter your assignment title, due date and worth.  
Click the "Save" button.

### Delete An Existing Assignment

Tap on the assignment you want to delete and select "Delete Assignment" on the prompt.

### Edit An Assignment

Tap on the assignment you want to edit and select "Edit Assignment" from the prompt.  
Enter the updated information into the fields and click the save button.  
If you change your mind before saving simply tap the back button in the top left corner.  
*Be careful when editing - once you save the changes, old information can't be retrieved!*
