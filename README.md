# StuPla - ReadMe
This is an independent project for 3rd Year Software Development in GMIT. The project (including Design Document) was worth 100% of a 5-credit module. The module ran for one semester, from January to late April.

## What is StuPla?
StuPla is an app developed by a student, for students. Currently the main feature of the app is assignment tracking, giving the user the ability to:

- Add assignments: complete with title, due date and worth
- Edit and Delete existing assignments
- Mark an existing assignment as "Complete" or "Incomplete"

StuPla also has countdowns displayed with each assignment, making it easy for users to see how long is left for each assignment and plan out their time accordingly. User authentication coupled with a cloud-based database means the user can view their assignments from any device - the app also takes up very little space when installed.

For the definitive guide on how to use StuPla, see the [User Guide](https://github.com/danielcregggmit/3rd-year-software-project-rebeccabernie/blob/master/UserGuide.md).

The [Design Document](https://github.com/danielcregggmit/3rd-year-software-project-rebeccabernie/wiki) contains an in-depth account of features, technology behind the app and design methodology, as well as other useful information such as system setup/requirements.  

## Download the App

You can download StuPla from the Google Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.stupla106948).  

We do not send out emails (except for password reset requests) - your email is only used for authentication and database set up. We also do not pass on any emails to any third parties.

## The Future of StuPla
I aim to keep growing this app, and I hope to have a remember-user function as well as notifications implemented before September 2017.
