# StuPla - ReadMe
This is an independent project for 3rd Year Software Development in GMIT. The project (including Design Document) was worth 100% of a 5-credit module. The module ran for one semester, from January to late April.

The [Design Document](https://github.com/danielcregggmit/3rd-year-software-project-rebeccabernie/wiki) contains an in-depth account of features, technology behind the app and design methodology, as well as other useful information such as system setup/requirements.
